COUPLE

I made the following code work on ubuntu 22.04 LTS (lammps_dftb may also work on 24.04 LTS depending on the python2 environment). The version of DFTB+ used is 23.1. These utilize file input and output.

lammps_dftb: We have improved the "atomic_style" to use "charge" in anticipation of use in battery materials. It is not difficult to create the input file using Ovito.

fortran_dftb: This example code only allows one atomic species, so "simple.f90" will need to be modified for more complex structures.

lammps_nwchem: We have improved the "atomic_style" to use "charge" in anticipation of use in battery materials. Change the "lammps_nwchem" from lammps-29Oct20 (lammps-29Oct2020.tar.gz).

Although it depends on the GPU and environment, OpenMP may perform faster calculations. Therefore, it is a good idea to consider using DFTBP (https://github.com/by-student-2017/DFTBP).
